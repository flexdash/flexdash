FlexDash: A Flexible Web IoT Dashboard
==================================

**WARNING: this is demoware at this point**

FlexDash is a dashboard that runs in the browser and is fully self-contained:
feed it data over a websocket and save its config as a blob on the server and
you have an IoT dashboard.

Special support for Node-RED is available in the form of a couple of FlexDash
nodes in the
[node-red-contrib-flexdash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-flexdash)
npm package.

In more detail:
- The dashboard is built with Vue and Vuetify and uses web components to display
  typical IoT or home automation widgets: gauges, sparklines, plots, switches,
  data tables, etc.
- Serving up the dashboard is easy: it's just a bunch of static files.
  Editing and configuring the set of widgets is done directly in the browser.
- The dashboard connects to a server via a websocket or using socket.io,
  that's how it expects to be fed data. The data consists of simple json
  messages with a (hierarchical) topic and a payload. The widgets can then
  be hooked up to a specific topic and as data comes in for that topic it
  is displayed.
- The dashboard's configuration is saved over the websocket as a special
  topic. So the server should persist that topic's payload and replay
  it when a client connects.
- The dashboard is targeted to be used with Node-RED, but it is really
  very independent of Node-RED and could be hooked up to something as
  simple as a microcontroller, such as an esp32.

## Getting started

See the live demo at https://tve.github.io/flexdash. The data you see is randomly generated
internally, just enough to be able to play around a little. The demo includes help text that
guides you through the dashboard as well as setting up data connections. Most widgets also include
help text that becomes visible when editing an instantiation of the widget.

For info on how to "run" FlexDash more permanently, see the section on Loading FlexDash below.

## Concepts

There are a few core concepts in FlexDash that drive its functioning as well as user interface.
This section explains each of them in some detail. It's probably best to read this after trying out
the demo...

### Topic tree
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39480/122462037-f17d4800-cf68-11eb-8499-fae846292efb.png" width="200" align="right">

The topic tree is the concept used by FlexDash to organize data and, in particular, to link
data sent by the server with widgets that display it. The topic tree is similar to pub/sub
topics as used in MQTT, but not exactly.

The short description is that the server sends data using JSON messages that contain a topic
property and a payload property. Each widget in the dashboard is then linked (you could
say "subscribes to") a topic and displays the data in the payload. Topics are
hierarchical using a slash as delimiter. A simple message might be something like:
```
{ "topic": "sensors/house/bedroom/temperature", "payload": 65 }
```
And you might have a gauge widget whose `value` input is linked to that topic and then
displays the last received temperature.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39480/122461586-6308c680-cf68-11eb-8f9f-670b4df9afb9.png" width=300 align="left">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39480/122461817-b2e78d80-cf68-11eb-91a9-c9d66d562842.png" width=150>

#### Arrays and objects

The topic tree does not have to contain just simple values, it can also contain arrays and objects.
Unlike most pub/sub systems, a topic in FlexDash is really a path in a large JSON data structure and
incoming messages insert or update data in that data structure. What this means is best described by
example. Suppose the server sends a message like:
```
{ "topic": "sensors/house/bedroom",
  "payload": { "temperature": 65, "humidity": 43, "temp_color": "green", "temp_unit": "Â°F" }
}
```
Here the payload is an object and it replaces the subtree rooted at `sensors/house/bedroom`.
The gauge in the previous example can still be bound to `sensors/house/bedroom/temperature`
but in addition, the gauge's _unit_ input can be bound to `sensors/house/bedroom/temp_unit`
and its _color_ input to `sensors/house/bedroom/temp_color`.

To display a time series plot the server might send a message like:
```
{ "topic": "timeseries/house/temperatures/data",
  "payload": [ [ 1623846600, 65, 72 ], [ 1623846900, 65.5, 73 ], ..., [ 1623889200, 68, 66 ] ]
}
```
This data consists of an array of "rows" where each row has a unix epoch timestamp (seconds since
1/1/1970) and two values.
This type of data can be displayed by linking the input of a TimePlot widget to the above topic.
The server can, in addition, send a second message with the names of the series being displayed,
for example:
```
{ "topic": "timeseries/house/temperatures/series",
  "payload": [ "bedroom", "living room" ]
}
```
and this can be linked to the _labels_ input of the TimePlot widget.

(For completeness sake it should be noted that a Gauge input linked to
`timeseries/house/temperatures/data/1/2` would show the value `73` as the `/1/2` are interpreted
as array indexes.)

### Tabs, grids, panels, widgets

The FlexDash UI is organized hierarchically in tabs, grids, panels, and widgets. Panels are
optional in that widgets can be placed directly into grids.

__Tabs__ are full pages that display information. Each tab has an icon and/or a name and these are
shown in the top-nav bar or the "hamburger button" activated left-nav on small devices.

Each tab can have one or multiple __grids__ filled with widgets. Each grid spans the full width of
the page and has variable height depending on the widgets it contains. The standard grid uses the
relatively new CSS grid functionality configured as follows:

- each grid column has a minimum width and the browser places as many columns as fit the
  window and then expands all the columns just enough to fill the full window width.
- each grid row has a fixed height approx 1/2 of the column width.
- widgets can be configured to span multiple rows and columns.
- all widgets in a grid are in a 1-dimensional order, they are dropped into the grid in that order
  starting at the top-left corner and going across to the right and then wrapping to the next row.
- when widgets span columns this can cause gaps, for example, a large widget may not fit in the
  space left at the end of a row and wraps to the next row), small widgets that come later in the
  order are "moved up" by the browser to fill these gaps (to-do item: provide a UI option to turn
  this behavior off).

Overall the grid provides a "responsive" layout that reflows as needed on smaller displays yet uses
the full width on larger ones. One constraint is that the grid always has at least as many columns
as the widest widget.
So if a grid has a 6-column wide widget that is the grid's narrowest configuration
and may well be wider than a cell phone display, for example.
The non-intuitive part here is that it's not just the wide widget that will exceed the
width of the screen but the grid as a whole and thus other small widgets will be off-screen too
(to-do item: figure out horizontal scrolling).

A __widget__ is a display element that visualizes some data. It looks like a card in the UI and may
have a title. A typical widget has a number of _inputs_ that can be configured using the pencil
edit icon in its top-right corner. Each input can have a static value, for example, setting
the _color_ to "red", or it can be linked/bound/subscribed to a topic as described in the previous
section.

There is a special __panel__ widget that can contain other widgets. The panel is an empty card
that can be configured to contain a CSS grid with a specific number of columns and rows.
This grid can then be filled just like the tabs' grid.
The important difference is that the panel's CSS grid does _not_ reflow or
change with display size.
Once configured to have a certain number of rows and columns and filled
with an arrangement of widgets everything will stay exactly like that regardless of display or
browser window resizing. This allows complex arrangements of widgets to be created that contain a
number of visualizations and input elements whose placement relative to one another is important.
Note that widgets placed into a panel do not have a card background: they sit flat in the panel's
card.

(To be exact, the panel's grid columns and rows _can_ expand slightly to fully fill the card,
this happens as the outer grid's columns also expand slightly to fill the width of the page).

### Iframes

In addition to the normal tabs, grids, and widgets it is possible to embed content from other
sites into FlexDash using HTML IFrames. There are 3 different iframes to choose from: tab iframes,
grid iframes and widget iframes.

Widget iframes are the simplest: they have a URL input and create an iframe the size of the widget
into which the content from the URL is loaded.

Tab iframes are more complex in order to allow portions of sites with their own tabs to be embedded
efficiently in FlexDash, this is particularly relevant to the std Node-RED dashboard.
An iframe tab consists of
a single iframe that takes up the entirety of the window below the top-nav bar. It is filled from a
URL specified for the tab.

A special feature is that FlexDash provides two "iframe slots", which are used to embed multiple
tabs of a site. The purpose of the slots is to avoid double navigation bars, i.e., the FlexDash
top-nav and the embedded site's top-nav. This works particularly well with the std Node-RED
dashboard because its top-nac can be disabled and it can be navigated using "hash navigation".

Without slots, if multiple tabs were created in FlexDash and each linked to 
a tab of the other site the web page would contain multiple copies of that other site, one
for each such iframe tab. By using slots all the FlexDash tabs that embed the
other site can use the same iframe slot, which means they actually display the same HTML iframe
and cause the tab switch to happen by navigating the content of the iframe. The result is that
there is only a single copy of the other site and switching from one of its tabs to another is
efficient.

### Live editing and undo

All editing in FlexDash is done live, i.e., changes occur immediately on the fully functioning
dashboard. This makes it easy to try different settings and see the results. There is no
"save" or "cancel" confirmation for anything. Instead, FlexDash has an undo button (in the
top-nav on the right-hand side) which can quickly undo any mistake.

### User input and Output events

User input such as toggling a switch widget also involves messages with topics, but
these are not related to the topic tree above. Widgets that implement user input have one
_output_ which is linked to a topic. On user input the widget sends a JSON message
with the configured topic and a payload representing the user's input to the server.
The details of the payload depend on the widget.

The most tricky aspect of user input is the combination of direct visual feedback in FlexDash and
the loop-back via the server showing effects of the action. It's easy to create situations that are
confusing or misleading.

A trivial example is an ON button. When the user clicks the button the visual feedback consists of
the button looking depressed for the brief duration of the click. Then a message goes to the server
and causes some change and perhaps the server sends a message to FlexDash to turn a Stat widget from
"OFF" to "ON". There's little to get confused by here.

A more tricky example is a toggle switch used to turn a light on/off, the reason being that the
toggle is really both an indicator and an actuator: it shows the current state and it allows the
user to change that state. When the user clicks on the toggle FlexDash shows the toggle
moving from one state to the other so the user gets visual feedback. Then it sends a message to the
server which must turn it back around to send the updated state back to FlexDash.
This message will have no visual effect because it should essentially confirm the change that
FlexDash has already performed.
This loop-back is nevertheless required because other browser instances do not see the user action
and need the message from the server to correctly reflect the new light switch state.

In the case of the toggle it would be possible to omit the local visual feedback because the
loop-back through the server ought to happen in less than a second and so while the visual change of
the switch might feel sluggish upon clicking it would be OK. But that is not the case for sliders or
increment/decrement buttons on a numeric input. For this reason FlexDash widgets always provide
immediate local visual feedback even though this risks being misleading if the message to the server
gets lost.

### Loading the dashboard

FlexDash consists of a bunch of static files that the browser loads. Once loaded, the web app then
connects to a server (or multiple) to receive data and send user input. The FlexDash files can
be hosted anywhere subject to a few constraints due to the various "same origin" policies
enforced by browsers.

Options for loading and configuring FlexDash:
- Point your browser at https://tve.github.io/flexdash and use the HTTP or HTTPS demo, you can
  then interactively establish a data connection. This is great to try things out.
- Point your browser at the demo and use a query string to tell FlexDash how to establish a
  data connection. If you bookmark the URL with query string this is a workable solution,
  but it doesn't look pretty in the address bar.
- Copy the [start.html](https://github.com/tve/flexdash/blob/main/public/start.html) template
  to your own web server (for example, Node-RED's static pages) and edit the `flexdash_options`.
  This lets the browser load the hosted FlexDash files, but allows you to customize FlexDash
  (title and theme) and pre-define the data connection.
- Download the (_not yet available..._) FlexDash bundle and host it on your own web server.
  This way you're independent of the hosted files. You can customize FlexDash by editing
  index.html at the top level.
- Clone the FlexDash repo, custommize to your heart's content, run `npm run build` and host the
  resulting dist directory wherever you want to.

Underneath all this there are 2 ways to load FlexDash:
- Using the `index.html` it loads as a normal single page web app, this is what happens
  for the hosted demo version. It is possible to configure FlexDash options in the `index.html`
  itself if you host all the files yourself.
- Using the `start.js` script FlexDash "installs" itself onto the enclosing web page. This
  allows for the top-level html page to be in one location where it can be customized and
  for the FlexDash files to be elsewhere, for example, hosted. The `start.html` page is
  a sample for using `start.js`.

The "same origin" policies cause the following constraints:
- If FlexDash is served by the same server that will also provide the data connection then
  everything is easy, "same server" means same protocol (http vs https), same hostname/IP
  address, and same port, if any of these differ it's not the "same origin".
- The file relevant to "FlexDash is served by" is the top-level HTML file, it doesn't matter
  where the actual assets come from. This means that
  _the by far easiest way to deal with CORS restrictions is to serve the top-level HTML_
  _file from the server that will provide the data connection._ The bulk of the FlexDash files
  can come from elsewhere, if more convenient.
- If FlexDash is served via HTTPS it is effectively impossible to establish a data connection via
  HTTP, instead, FlexDash has to be served via HTTP as well, or better yet, the data server should
  be upgraded to HTTPS.
- If FlexDash is served by a different server than the one it connects to for data the data server
  has to have CORS configured to allow the connection. Specifically, CORS needs to be configured to
  allow the server that serves up FlexDash as origin.

Details about CORS: CORS stands for
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) and its
purpose is to protect access to a data/API server. The primary threat is as follows. Suppose
you access your data server using it's normal web app and, after logging in, your browser stores
a login session cookie. You then happen to visit an innocuous looking web site but under the
hood, invisible to you, the pages served by that web site connect from your browser to your data
server and start to issue API commands. Because your server stored that cookie and includes the
cookie in all requests to your data server these API commands will be authorized and potentially
perform nefarious actions.

What configuring CORS entails is for your data server to tell the browser via a response header that
it will accept a data connection / API calls from a web app served off a specific domain.
So suppose your data server is `https://my-node-red.example.com:1880` and you are using the
hosted FlexDash from `https://tve.github.com` then the data server needs to respond with a
`Access-Control-Allowed-Origins: https://tve.github.com` header (or alternatively the wildcard
`Access-Control-Allowed-Origins: *`). If you use the FlexDash NPM module in Node-RED then it
has support for the CORS configuration and is permissive by default.

### Server connections, URL navigation, and saving the configuration

_The text in this subsection is copied verbatim from the demo "guide", it needs to be rewritten._

When you brought up the dashboard it had no connection and established a "demo connection".
The socket.io connection you added is only used as additional method for sending/receiving data.
The dashboard configuration is not saved anywhere! So if you reload the browser you're back to
demo square one.

FlexDash can connect to multiple servers to receive data and send user input but it uses only one
connection to load its configuration from and save changes to. Since this connection is used to load
the configuration it must be specified somehow when the dashboard is first loaded.
This is accomplished by specifying a query string that configures the server
connection from the get-go. For socket.io the query string has the form
`sio=http://example.com:1234/path`, which, if running Node-Red locally
might look as follows (__FIXME:__ _this example doesn't work due to http/https issues_):

  http://tve.github.io/flexdash/?sio=http://localhost:1880/io/flexdash/

To connect to a server using a plain websocket use a query string of the form
`ws=wss://example.com:2000/path`.

It is also possible to open a specific tab at start-up (instead of the first tab) by appending
a hash URL extension with the name or the icon name of the tab. E.g., append `#mytab` to the URL.

#### Persisting the configuration with Node-RED

To ensure that Node-RED persists the dashboard configuration a context store that uses the local
filesystem instead of just memory may need to be enabled. The guide on
[working with context storage](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context) has
some background, but the short is to locate the "contextStorage" setting in the \`settings.js\`
and enable a context store with \`localfilesystem\`.
The following example configuration provides a default memory context store
and an optional persistent one:

    contextStorage: {
        default: { module: "memory" },
        persistent: { module: "localfilesystem" }
    },

After setting up the persistent context store its name needs to be entered into
the FlexDash configuration node ("persistent" in the above example).
After editing the settings Node-RED needs to be restarted for everything to take effect.

Once all the above is done do test the result! An easy way is to pull up the empty dashboard
and inject one of the demo tabs. Then reload the browser and it should come right back with
the dashboard that has the added demo tab. Then restart Node-RED and reload the browser again
and you should still get the same dashboard with the added demo tab. If the demo tab is gone
the localfilesystem context store didn't work.

At this point any changes made to the dashboard are persistent.
The actual config can be found in the Node-RED admin UI using the context store panel
and the global context variables.

## Getting and creating panels and widgets

FlexDash comes with a small number of widgets built-in. In order to expand its functionality
the following options are planned, from easiest to most complex...
(All this is very preliminary and not yet worked out, it's really a "this is the plan" section!

### Download ready-made widgets

All web components used in FlexDash (widgets are web components) are pre-processed and
bundled. Published widgets you can download should consist of such a bundled file you can
drop on your web server.
_Some details need to be worked out to tell FLexDash to load these widgets._

### Assemble a panel

Sometimes custom functionality can be assembled using existing components creatively
arranged in a panel. Just add a panel to your grid and then add widgets to that panel.

### Write a custom panel

If a panel almost does it but you need some custom logic or more precise control over
the visuals then you can write a custom panel-like widget, i.e., put together a few
existing widgets and complement them with some custom logic.
The [Thermostat widget](https://github.com/tve/flexdash/blob/main/src/widgets/thermostat.vue) is
an example that can be used as a starting point: its HTML template consists of stacking
a few existing widgets and the Javascript code wires up all the inputs. This latter portion is
a bit verbose and tedious, so this option is primarily useful if some custom logic is needed
as well.

### Write a custom widget

You can easily get started on a new widget by copying the source code file of an existing widget,
making it available to FlexDash, and telling FlexDash to load it.
_The details of the last two steps need to be worked out but appear doable!_

FlexDash will pre-process the source file and add the resulting widget to the
palette so you can add it to a grid to test it out. If you change the widget source
you can have FlexDash reload it.

The one gotcha with this method is that it's not great for "production" use after you
finish working on your widget. The reason is that FlexDash will have to pre-process the
source file each time it is loaded. For one widget this may be OK but as such source code
widgets accumulate the lag will build up.

For "production" use you will need to pre-process and bundle the widget and use it
just like you would use a downloaded widget (first section above).

## Quick architecture overview (OUTDATED)

- FlexDash uses the Vue 2 web framework and the Vuetify component
  library for the UI, not much else.
  Moving to Vue 3 would be awesome but Vuetify doesn't support it
  yet, other component libraries for Vue don't either...
- At the very bottom layer of the UI are the widgets that show some
  data visualization. They are all loaded from `src/widgets` and are
  mostly pretty simple wrappers around some generic web component or
  some html/css/svg/... Writing new widgets is expected to be the
  main way to customize FlexDash.
- The top-level component is in `src/Dash.vue`, it manages the top-nav and
  plops down the appropriate grid for the selected tab.
- Data connections are accessed via a network icon in the top-nav and
  the code is found in `src/connections`.
- The grid is in `src/grids/fixed-grid.vue` and deals with laying out the
  widgets. It's a simple HTML grid currently. It also manages the editing,
  including the buttons in the toolbar at the top and dealing with
  cancel/save actions.
- The grid is populated by widgets, the top level of that is
  `src/components/widget-edit.vue` which implements the actual editing
  "drawer". It deals with figuring out the types of the inputs and 
  producing the right input field.
- Below that sits `src/components/widget-wrapper.vue` which manages the
  live data feeds to the widgets. The configuration is passed down the
  component hierarchy but the data is bound by widget-wrapper to
  flow "directly" from the data store to the widget component.
  This data flow is reactive (like just about everything else) so
  widgets update as soon as new data shows up in the store.
- The store is a simple object tree representing the topics and
  having data (payload) at the leaves. It is updated as data comes in
  from the server and any property of a widget can be bound to
  any value in the store (or be configured to a static value).
  Given the appropriate binding, it is thus possible to update the title,
  line thickness, color, or any propety of a widget by sending data
  from the server.
- The configuration of the dashboard is also held in the store
  under a top-level `$config` key. It consists of shallow denormalized
  arrays for tabs, grids, and widgets. Each entity has an ID and the
  hierarchy is connected by ID reference, e.g., a grid has an array
  of the widgets IDs it contains. The configuration for the demo
  mode can be found in `src/components/demo.vue`.
- There a start at unit tests in `tests/unit` but they haven't kept up.
